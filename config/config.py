    Typically, unsupervised algorithms make inferences from datasets using only input vectors without referring to 
    known, or labelled, outcomes. 
    \nYouâ€™ll define a target number k, which refers to the number of centroids you need in the dataset.
    A centroid is the imaginary or real location representing the center of the cluster.
    Every data point is allocated to each of the clusters through reducing the in-cluster sum of squares.
    \nIn other words, the K-means algorithm identifies k number of centroids, and then allocates every data point
    to the nearest cluster, while keeping the centroids as small as possible.""",
